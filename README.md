# NewsAIdProject
Introducing NewsAId, an innovative news generation tool developed by four dedicated Boston University students for their CS411 project. Leveraging the powerful OpenAI API, NewsAId transforms the way news articles are created, offering unprecedented simplicity and customization.

# Key Features:

**Simplicity at Its Core:** With NewsAId, creating a detailed news article is as simple as filling out a brief form. Users need only select the desired style and length, and provide a few key details about the content they want covered.

**Fully Customizable Content:** Tailor your news articles to meet specific needs with adjustable user inputted parameters. Whether itâ€™s a concise summary or an in-depth report, NewsGen AI writes with precision and flair, adhering strictly to the input parameters.

**Effortless Sharing:** Once your custom article is crafted, sharing it is just a click away. NewsGen AI includes built-in functionality to seamlessly distribute your news across various platforms, making it easier than ever to keep your audience informed.

# How do I start?
It's very simple! First, clone this repository, and open this in your IDE of choice. Then, run the following commands in the terminal (Note, make sure you're in the NewsAId directory). 
```
python3 packagesinstall.py
```
```
python3 startNewsAId.py
```
Note: It is AI not AL! Also, these programs are designed for Apple Mac M1 laptops, so they may not work as desired on other machines. If this is the case, you may need to manually go through the code and run the commands in the two programs above. 
These two commands will install all packages necessary, and start the program. Be sure to allow access to the terminal. 

# What do I do once I'm in???
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to start your NewsAId journey! From here, you will login/signup using Google Oauth or directly through us. Then, you will be redirected to a form. Pick and choose the parameters that you desire for your article. After this, you can add the information that you want in your article, and pick a length; please note that this must be a word count between 100 and 500. 

# How do I quit the app?
Simply just exit from the terminals that were created, and the program is closed!

# This is a WIP
As of 4/28/24, this is the MVP. In the future, we want to actually deploy this project for people to use. We'd like to further fine tune the parameters, and add more customizability.
