# NewsAIdProject
Introducing NewsAId, an innovative news generation tool developed by four dedicated Boston University students for their CS411 project. Leveraging the powerful OpenAI API, NewsAId transforms the way news articles are created, offering unprecedented simplicity and customization.

# Key Features:

**Simplicity at Its Core:** With NewsAId, creating a detailed news article is as simple as filling out a brief form. Users need only select the desired style and length, and provide a few key details about the content they want covered.
**Fully Customizable Content:** Tailor your news articles to meet specific needs with adjustable user inputted parameters. Whether itâ€™s a concise summary or an in-depth report, NewsGen AI writes with precision and flair, adhering strictly to the input parameters.
**Effortless Sharing:** Once your custom article is crafted, sharing it is just a click away. NewsGen AI includes built-in functionality to seamlessly distribute your news across various platforms, making it easier than ever to keep your audience informed.

# How do I start?
It's very simple! First, clone this repository, and open this in your IDE of choice. Then, run the following commands in the terminal (Note, make sure you're in the NewsAId directory). 
```
